    <h2>Rule an Ancient City</h2>
    <p>
            Towers and Temples is the winner of the 2017 Palmer 
            Medal for Best New Simulation Board Game. 
            Players adopt role cards of characters from ancient 
            Greece and Rome in an attempt to manage 
            the administration of a city. Each role provides 
            a different ability and strategy. However, 
            one role card belongs to a deadly assassin and players 
            must be constantly aware of betrayal 
            and double-cross. This card game provides a ton 
            of enjoyment and can handle up to eight players 
            and expansion packs available for larger parties. 
    </p>
    <p>
            This is a nicely balanced game, where each player must 
            carefully choose his or her roles and 
            the strategies can quickly change with the turn 
            of a card. However the level of randomness is 
            just right and cunning and resourcefulness can 
            overcome bad luck (if given time.) I do not 
            recommend this game unless there are at least 4 
            players; less than that reduces the intrigue 
            and some of the game appeal.

    <h2>Highly Recommended</h2>
    <p>
            Towers and Temples is a great game. The balance is 
            just about perfect and each player must 
            carefully choose roles each turn. Even though the 
            strategic possibilities are nearly endless, 
            the game is simple to learn. The replay value is 
            high and gets even better when you replace 
            some of the cards with new cards available in the 
            expansion packs.
